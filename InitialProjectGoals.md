# Project Goals #

What do we want to do with this project? Do we want to write a general purpose client, a client with a special sort of UI, or just a jabber module for a bigger project?

One thing is clear, we want to use the **agsXMPP** api to write this in C#. Luckily agsXMPP ships with a few client implementations using their API, and they work on Mono or MS.Net.
